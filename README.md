# Running data analysis project
The goal of this little project is to maintain my own database and analysis of my running, which I want to host on project's GitHub page at http://ebrensi.github.io/running_data.  I'd like for anyone to navigate to this project's page and see current summary information for my running activities, with some sort of interactive visualization.

  * update 3/30/2016: I'm going to start by making a little web app to display a heatmap of all my running waypoints.
    * First I'm going to make a simple heatmap, and then develop that into a live app that automatically gets updated as new activities get added.  My actvities are currently in a Dropbox folder that gets populated by the excellent [Tapiriik](https://tapiriik.com) app, which grabs them from Garmin Connect.  I might get ambitious and grab the activities from Garmin myself, but for now I'm just trying to get a javascript rendering of GIS points in a CSV file that is generated by [rundata.py](rundata.py)
